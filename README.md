# Aim:
To build a C program that prints integer, float,character, and string literals on the console using the printf() function.
# Algorithm:
# Step 1:
  Start
  
# Step 2: 
  Include the standard input-output library: #include<stdio.h>.
  
# Step 3: 
  Inside the main() function, use printf() to display each literal along with its size in bytes using sizeof() :
  
   3.1 Integer literal (e.g., 10) using `%d`
   
   3.2 Float literal (e.g., 3.14) using `%f`
   
   3.3 Character literal (e.g., 'A') using `%c`
   
   3.4 String literal (e.g., "Hello C") using `%s`
   
# Step 4: Stop
# Program:















# Output:



# Result: 
Thus, the program was implemented and executed successfully, and the required output was obtained.
